## Project Overview

Implemented a microservices-based project using Flask for the backend, MongoDB for data storage, and orchestration through Kubernetes (k8) via Minikube. The project aimed to provide video to MP3 conversion services with an efficient and scalable architecture.

## Key Features

- Utilized Flask for the backend services, providing a robust and scalable foundation.
- Employed MongoDB for data storage, ensuring seamless handling of user requests and processed videos.
- Orchestrated the entire system using Kubernetes (k8) through Minikube, showcasing efficient deployment and operations management.
- Improved communication efficiency by integrating RabbitMQ for precise message handling.
- User-requested videos were stored and processed, with RabbitMQ managing messages and triggering email notifications for job completion.
- Implemented user authentication to ensure secure access to their files.
